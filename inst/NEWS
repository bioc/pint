  o as.data.frame fixed

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.63 (2010-01-11)

  o Added many new development features that help to handle segmented
    data (options segmented and nonmatched, and related scripts). Will
    be documented properly in later versions.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.35 (2010-12-30)

BUG FIXES 

  o in pint.match added rownames check between Y$info and
    Y$data, previously only number of rows was checked for Y data. For
    X data things were ok: both row number and row names were checked

  o in pint.data call within pint.match, the X data set was
    erroneously used for both X and Y calls. Now calling Y for Y and X
    for X. Also polishing replace.inf part. Now also naming the info field
    rows correctly.
    
NEW FEATURES
   
  o checking info fields in pint.data for synonymous terms: replacing
    "chromosome" with "chr" and "stop" with "end". Requires less
    tweaking from the end user.

  o if chromosome names X or Y used, replace these with 23 and
    24. This makes code compatible with any organism.

MISC
 
  o changed the internal function name 'impute' to 'imputation'

  o moved some functionality from pint.match to pint.data

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.33 (2010-12-09)

BUG FIXES

 o corrected bug in impute.R function which produced NAs

 o added replace.inf in pint.data; now this preprocessing function
   (and consequently pint.match) replaces infinite values with large
   values by default

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.32 (2010-12-09)

NEW FEATURES

 o imputation option added (default TRUE) to pint.match and improved
   in pint.data
 

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.3 (2010-10-21)

NEW FEATURES

  o GenomeModels and ChromosomeModels classes have getModelNumbers
  method
  o topGenes and topModels methods have default values
  o screen.cgh.mrna checks whether data has been segmented and 
  warns the user

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.2 (2010-10-20)

NEW FEATURES

  o Default value for windowSize argument in screening function 
    changed

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.1 (2010-10-19)

NEW FEATURES

  o Segmented gene copy number data can be screened with pSimCCA
    method, although it is not recommended.
  o Output type of screening functions can changed to a data frame.
  o All dependency model outputs from screening functions can now
    converted to a data frame with as.data.frame method.
  o ChromosomeArmModels can be accessed with [['p']] and [['q']]
    from ChromosomeModels.

BUG FIXES

  o z.effects gives a proper error message when the window size is
    too large.
  o pCCA method gives a proper error message when the data matrix is not
    invertible.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.17 (2010-10-15)

HELP & Rd FILE CHANGES

  o sample and genes are displayed in correct order in help pages
    for screening functions

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.16 (2010-08-04)

BUG FIXES

  o screening functions can handle chromosomes with fewer samples
  than window size
  o isEmpty method is now exported
  o topModels method for ChromosomeModels class gives no longer
  an error when either arm has no dependency models

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.15 (2010-06-16)

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o updates to pint.match function. Now confirms that 'data' and
  'info' fields in the input data matrices are converted to have
  matching elements (corresponding to geneids, for example). Also an
  option to include only selected chromosomes was added. Works now
  with both X/Y or 23/24 annotation for the chromosomes; characters
  and numerics are both ok. Changes affect also the screen.mrna.cgh
  function which calls pint.match (and other functions that call it)

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.1 (2010-06-04)

NEW FEATURES

  o matches the samples between cgh and mrna data (screen.cgh.mrna
    function) automatically based on sample names
  o matches genes between cgh and mrna data (screen.cgh.mrna function)
    based on chromosomal locations. User-defined distance threshold
    can be given.

BUG FIXES

  o added robustness towards missing values

  o function to format data for packages dependency model calculation added (pint.data)
  o function to pair data sets added (pint.match)

  contribution to dependency model
